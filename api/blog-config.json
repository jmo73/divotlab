    "what_it_is": "DataGolf produces modeled skill estimates — recency-weighted projections of expected strokes-gained relative to an average PGA Tour field. These are not raw PGA Tour ShotLink statistics. They are derived from a predictive model that adjusts scores across tournaments and tours, weights recent rounds more heavily, and regresses toward the mean for small sample sizes.",
    "how_to_reference": "Use phrases like 'DataGolf's skill model', 'DataGolf's projected strokes gained', 'according to DataGolf's skill estimates', or 'DataGolf rates [player] at [value]'. For stat callout labels, use 'DataGolf Skill Estimate' or 'DataGolf Projected SG' rather than just 'SG: Category'. When referencing category breakdowns (OTT, APP, ARG, PUTT), note that these are model estimates — DataGolf's own FAQ states the sum of category estimates may not equal the total skill estimate for technical reasons.",
    "why_it_matters": "DataGolf's model incorporates data from every OWGR-sanctioned tour plus LIV and a comprehensive amateur database. It adjusts for field strength differences across tours (beating a PGA Tour field by 2 strokes means more than beating a European Tour field by 2). The recency weighting means these ratings reflect current form, not career averages. This makes them more predictive than simple season averages or raw ShotLink numbers.",

    "Never start with 'In the world of golf' or any cliche opener. Start with a specific moment, a specific number, or a claim that makes someone stop scrolling.",
    "First paragraph sets the narrative tension — a question, a contradiction, or a surprising fact. The reader should feel like they need the answer before they can close the tab.",
    "Use real player names and real numbers. Never hedge with 'approximately' when you have the exact figure. Confidence in the data is what separates this from every other golf blog.",
    "Stat callouts break up the text at natural pause points. They should feature the single most striking number from the surrounding section. The label must clearly indicate the data source — use 'DataGolf Skill Estimate' or 'DataGolf Projected SG' rather than implying these are official PGA Tour stats.",
    "One pullquote per post maximum. It should feel like something a real person would say — an insight that makes the reader nod, not a motivational poster.",
    "Section headings (h2) should be short, punchy, and create curiosity. Think magazine subheads, not Wikipedia sections. Never use generic headings like 'Analysis' or 'Data' or 'Conclusion'.",
    "End with a forward-looking thought, a practical takeaway, or a question that lingers. Never summarize what was just said. The reader should leave feeling like they know something they didn't before.",
    "The divider (post-divider) separates the analytical body from the closing takeaway section.",
    "Attribution line at the bottom: 'Data via DataGolf's predictive skill model · [specific data context]'",
    "Tone: confident, direct, slightly understated. Like a good caddie — gives you the read, doesn't over-explain, trusts you to make the putt. Think The Ringer meets Golf Digest's analytics desk.",
    "Never use exclamation marks. The data creates the excitement, not the punctuation.",
    "Paragraphs should be 2-6 sentences. Let ideas breathe but don't leave them hanging. A paragraph should feel like a complete thought — not a fragment and not a wall.",
    "Use em dashes and colons for rhythm and emphasis. Vary sentence length — mix short punches with longer, more layered sentences that let an idea unfold. Monotonous sentence structure is the fastest way to sound like AI.",
    "Never use the phrase 'data-driven' or 'analytics-powered' or 'deep dive' or 'game-changer' — show it, don't label it.",
    "The word 'we' is used naturally to create shared investigation ('We looked closer', 'We pulled the numbers'). But don't overuse it — sometimes 'the data shows' or 'the numbers tell a different story' reads better.",
    "Vary your transitions. Never start consecutive paragraphs the same way. Avoid formulaic connectors like 'Furthermore', 'Additionally', 'Moreover', 'It's worth noting'. These are AI tells. Use natural bridges: callback to a previous point, a short rhetorical question, or just start the next thought.",
    "Include at least one moment of genuine golf insight — something that shows the writer actually understands the game, not just the spreadsheet. Reference the feel of a shot, a course condition, a broadcast moment, a player's demeanor. The reader should believe a golfer wrote this.",
    "Write like you're three beers into a conversation at the clubhouse with someone who loves golf as much as you do. Informed but not stiff. Smart but not showing off. Occasionally willing to have a take.",
    "Numbers should be introduced conversationally, not announced. Bad: 'The data shows that Scheffler's SG: Approach was +1.29.' Good: 'Scheffler gained 1.29 strokes per round on approach — best on tour by a margin that's almost uncomfortable to look at.'",
    "Never use 'landscape', 'realm', 'paradigm', 'delve', 'tapestry', 'multifaceted', 'nuanced', 'underscores', 'it's important to note', or 'at the end of the day'. These are dead giveaways of AI-generated content."
