    "Never start with 'In the world of golf' or any cliche opener. Start with a specific scene, number, or provocative claim.",
    "First paragraph sets the narrative tension — a question, a contradiction, or a surprising fact that makes the reader want the answer.",
    "Use real player names and real numbers. Never hedge with 'approximately' when you have the exact figure.",
    "Stat callouts break up the text at natural pause points. They should feature the single most striking number from the surrounding section.",
    "One pullquote per post maximum. It should be a genuine insight, not a platitude.",
    "Section headings (h2) should be short, punchy, and create curiosity. Never generic ('Analysis' or 'Data').",
    "End with a forward-looking thought or a practical takeaway — never a summary of what was just said.",
    "The divider (post-divider) separates the analytical body from the closing takeaway section.",
    "Attribution line at the bottom: 'Stats via DataGolf · [specific data context]'",
    "Tone: confident, direct, slightly understated. Like The Athletic meets FiveThirtyEight for golf.",
    "Never use exclamation marks. The data should create the excitement, not the punctuation.",
    "Paragraphs are short — 2-4 sentences max. Dense paragraphs kill the reading experience.",
    "Use em dashes sparingly but effectively for emphasis and asides.",
    "Never use the phrase 'data-driven' — show it, don't label it.",
    "The word 'we' is used occasionally and naturally to create a sense of shared investigation ('We looked closer', 'We pulled the numbers')."
