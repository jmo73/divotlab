# Divot Lab — Project Reference

This file is the source of truth for project context, conventions, and recurring tasks.
Claude should read this at the start of every session and update it whenever new recurring tasks, key decisions, or important patterns are introduced.

**RULE: Any time Claude creates something that requires future manual updates (JSON files, weekly tasks, new data sources), it must add an entry to the WEEKLY TASKS or MAINTENANCE section below before finishing.**

## Weekly Tasks — Must Be Done Every Tournament Week

### Wednesday (pick day)
1. **Open `admin.html`** in browser (gitignored local tool, password: `divotlab2026`)
   - **New Pick tab**: fill free pick → Download `current-pick.json` → replace → deploy
   - **Pro Picks tab**: fill all 4–5 picks → Download `pro-picks.json` → replace → deploy
     - Click "Pull from New Pick tab" to auto-fill tournament info
     - Click "Generate Newsletter HTML" → Copy → paste into Beehiiv as HTML Snippet
   - Fields: `tournament`, `week_of`, `published`, `pick.player`, `pick.bet_type`, `pick.bet_detail`, `pick.odds`, `pick.book`, `pick.reasoning`, `pick.confidence`
   - Set `pick.result` to `null` (pending)
   - `current-pick.json` drives `picks.html` (public free pick landing page)
   - `pro-picks.json` drives the "This Week's Card" section on `/pro`
2. **Create `lab-notes/lab-picks/YYYY-MM-DD-[tournament]-picks.html`** from the picks template for Beehiiv

### Tuesday (newsletter day)
1. **Create `lab-notes/issues/YYYY-MM-DD-[tournament].html`** from the Lab Notes template for Beehiiv
   - Run `node scripts/pull-data.js` then `node scripts/process-data.js` first
   - See `lab-notes/CLAUDE.md` for the full newsletter generation workflow

### Sunday evening / Monday
1. **Update `current-pick.json`** (Mark Result tab in admin.html):
   - Set `pick.result` to `"win"` or `"loss"`
   - Set `pick.result_detail` to a short result note (e.g. "Finished T4")
2. **Update `pro-picks.json`** (Pro Picks tab in admin.html — Load Current Values → update results → regenerate → download)
   - Each pick has `result` (win/loss/push/null) and `result_detail` fields
   - Results auto-show as WIN/LOSS badges on the Pro page picks card
3. **Update `lab-notes/lab-picks/season-tracker.json`**:
   - Update `totals` block: `total_picks`, `total_hits`, `hit_rate_pct`, `units.*`, `events_tracked`
   - Add the week's picks to `weekly_picks` array
   - This file drives: homepage tracker, lab-notes page tracker, picks.html record bar — all auto-update on deploy

## DataGolf API — Rate Limits

**45 requests per minute** — applies to ALL requests, not per-endpoint.
Exceeding the limit results in a **5-minute suspension**.

This is why the `/api/lab-data` endpoint fetches in batches of 3 with a 500ms delay between batches, and why caches are set aggressively (6hr pre-tournament, 5min during live play). Never add new parallel fetches without checking total request count against this limit.

## API Endpoints (divotlab-api.vercel.app)

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/subscribe` | Subscribe email to Beehiiv |
| `POST /api/auth/lab-picks` | Password auth for lab-picks.html |
| `GET /api/betting-odds` | DataGolf odds proxy |
| `GET /api/course-fit` | Course-fit leaderboard — normalized 0-100 scores for full field |
| `GET /api/derive-course-weights` | **Annual plan** — derives course weights from historical round SG data. Params: `event_id` (required), `top_n`, `years` |
| `GET /api/historical-rounds` | **Annual plan** — round-level SG data. Params: `tour`, `event_id`, `year` |
| `GET /api/historical-odds-outrights` | **Annual plan** — historical betting lines 2019–2025. Params: `book` (required), `tour`, `event_id`, `year`, `market` |
| `GET /api/historical-odds-matchups` | **Annual plan** — historical H2H/3-ball lines |
| `GET /api/historical-event-results` | **Annual plan** — actual finishes and earnings |
| `GET /api/historical-dfs` | **Annual plan** — DFS salaries and ownership |

## Beehiiv HTML Format Rules

All newsletter HTML is pasted as HTML Snippet blocks in Beehiiv:
- **Inline CSS only** — no `<style>` blocks
- **Table-based layout** for all structural elements
- **No `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` tags**
- Font stack: `'DM Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
- Max content width: 600px (Beehiiv handles this)
- Background `#0A0A0A` is set by the Beehiiv template
- See `lab-notes/CLAUDE.md` for full format spec

---

## Pages That Auto-Update from JSON

These pages fetch data client-side and update automatically when JSON files are updated and deployed:

| Page | Data source | What updates |
|---|---|---|
| `index.html` | `season-tracker.json` | Season tracker section |
| `lab-notes.html` | `season-tracker.json` | Season tracker section |
| `picks.html` | `current-pick.json` + `season-tracker.json` | Pick card + record bar + recent results |
| `pro.html` | `pro-picks.json` | "This Week's Card" section above tabs — all Pro picks with status badges |

**Deploy after updating any JSON file** — Vercel auto-deploys on push to main.

---

## Authentication — /pro page

Pro subscribers access `/pro` by entering the email they subscribed with. The API checks Beehiiv's Pro publication for an active subscription and grants 7-day browser access via localStorage.

**Required Vercel env var**: `BEEHIIV_PRO_PUB_ID` — the publication ID of the separate Lab Notes Pro Beehiiv publication (not the same as `BEEHIIV_PUB_ID` which is the free newsletter).

**API endpoint**: `POST /api/verify-pro` — body: `{email}`, returns `{verified: true/false}`

## Navigation — Final Structure (all pages)

```
[Logo] · Lab Picks (/picks) · The Lab (/the-lab) · Articles · Lab Notes · [Pro →] (/pro)
```

The Lab is free and public. Pro → is the gold CTA button linking to the gated premium hub.

## Growth — Free Trials & Account Improvements

Priority: get real users before optimizing revenue. Free trials → retention → word of mouth.

### Current auth model (limitation)
Email entered at gate → checked against Beehiiv Pro publication → 7-day localStorage token. No trial state, no referral tracking, no upgrade flow.

### Phase 1 — Free Trial (build next)
Goal: let anyone start a 14-day free trial without paying upfront.

1. **Add `POST /api/start-trial` endpoint** in `api/server.js`
   - Body: `{email}`
   - Store trial in a lightweight KV store (Vercel KV / Upstash Redis) — key: email, value: `{started, expires, converted}`
   - Return a trial token (7-day, same localStorage pattern as current auth)
   - Rate limit: 1 trial per email, ever

2. **Update gate on `/pro`** — add "Start Free Trial" button below the subscriber verify form
   - Flow: enter email → if no active sub → offer 14-day trial → API creates trial → access granted
   - Show trial expiry date in the user chip: "Trial · 11 days left"
   - At expiry: gate re-appears with "Your trial ended" + Stripe subscribe link

3. **Trial-to-paid email** (Beehiiv automation or manual for now)
   - Day 7 of trial: send "You're halfway through your trial" + what you've accessed
   - Day 13: "Trial ends tomorrow" + one-click subscribe

### Phase 2 — Referral Tracking
Currently: manual (subscribers reply with referral's name).

1. **Add `referral_code` to Beehiiv subscriber custom fields** (or use a simple JSON file)
2. **Stripe webhook** → on new Pro sub, check if referral code used → credit referring subscriber
3. **Referral dashboard** in admin.html — shows who referred whom, credits earned

### Phase 3 — Upgrade Flow
1. Replace Stripe buy link with a proper upgrade page that:
   - Pre-fills email from the trial session
   - Shows "You've been using Pro for X days" with usage highlights
   - One-click subscribe (Stripe Checkout)
2. Post-payment webhook → auto-add to Beehiiv Pro publication → access continues seamlessly

### What to build in what order
1. **Trial system** (highest impact — removes the friction of asking for $9.99 upfront)
2. **Referral code tracking** (the ask is in the launch email; need the infrastructure)
3. **Trial expiry email** (manual first, then automate)
4. **Upgrade flow** (after trials are converting)

### Referral incentive (current)
Free month per referral. Subscriber mentions referrer's name on signup → manual credit tracked in admin.html (to build). For now, handled by email reply.

---

## Active Projects / In Progress

- **Pro page (/pro)** — BUILT. Email-gated hub for Pro subscribers. Tabs: Course Fit (full field 0-100), Value Finder (sortable, edge + fit signal), H2H Tool (model insight), Live (live SG + Win%/Top5/10/20, auto-refresh 90s). "This Week's Card" above tabs from pro-picks.json.
- **Course-fit leaderboard** — BUILT. `leaderboard.html` + `/api/course-fit`. Top 10 free, full field paywalled. Next: course history component.
- **Course-fit model** — IMPROVED. 40+ course profiles, form blending (65% L24 + 35% L12), 0-100 normalized score. Next: derive weights from historical data via /api/derive-course-weights.
- **Between the Ears app partnership** — collaboration in early discussion. They integrate Divot Lab analytics, display "Powered by Divot Lab."
- **Twitter/X account** — just launched. Templates and evergreen tweet library built. Focus: pick reveals, data takes, reply engagement during tournament rounds.

## Pro Dashboard Build Roadmap

Full plan for expanding /pro with all available DataGolf data. Build in priority order.

### DataGolf Endpoint Status

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `preds/live-tournament-stats` | ✅ Live tab | Live SG per round, event avg |
| `preds/in-play` | ✅ Live tab | Win%/Top5/10/20 updated live |
| `preds/pre-tournament` | ✅ Value Finder | Pre-round finish probabilities |
| `betting-tools/outrights` | ✅ Value Finder | 4 markets, 6 books, model edge |
| `betting-tools/matchups` | ⚡ partial | API built, H2H tool manual only — needs Matchup Market tab |
| `preds/approach-skill` | ❌ not in UI | SG: App by distance bucket (100–125, 125–150, 150–175, 175–200, 200+) |
| `preds/player-decompositions` | ❌ not in UI | Skill components: driving, irons, wedges, short game |
| `preds/fantasy-projection-defaults` | ❌ not in UI | DFS salary + projected points |
| `historical-raw/rounds` | ❌ not in UI | Round-level SG + scoring, 22 tours |
| `historical-raw/event-results` | ❌ not in UI | Actual finishes, earnings, FedExCup pts |
| `historical-odds/outrights` | ❌ not in UI | Opening/closing lines 2019–2025 |
| `historical-odds/matchups` | ❌ not in UI | Historical H2H lines for backtesting |
| `historical-dfs` | ❌ not in UI | DK/FD points vs SG correlation |
| `preds/pre-tournament-archive` | ❌ not in UI | Historical pre-tournament predictions |

### Build Priority

**1. Matchup Market tab** — BUILT (2026-05-08)
- New tab on /pro showing the full live H2H + 3-ball board from `betting-tools/matchups`
- Three sub-views: Tournament Matchups, Round Matchups, 3-Balls
- Model edge column: DataGolf implied probability vs sportsbook line
- Value flag: highlight matchups where model disagrees with the market
- Picks highlighted (any player in pro-picks.json)
- Most actionable for bettors — replaces the manual H2H tool for pre-bet decisions

**2. Approach Skill distance panel**
- Click-to-expand row inside Course Fit table (or player hover card)
- Fetches `preds/approach-skill` — shows SG: App broken into distance buckets
- Genuine differentiator: shows if a player is elite from 150 but weak from 175
- Relevant when a course has a specific "scoring hole" distance

**3. Historical Backtesting dashboard**
- New section or tab: "Model Accuracy"
- Uses `historical-odds/outrights` + `historical-raw/event-results`
- For each course: when model ranked a player top-5 probability, how often did they finish top 5?
- Calibration chart: model probability bins vs actual hit rate
- This is the verification product — makes the track record scientific

**4. Player Trajectory indicators**
- Rising/Falling badge in Course Fit + Value Finder rows
- Compare L12 SG vs L24 SG per category — already computing both for blending
- "Rising" = L12 meaningfully above L24 in the categories this course rewards
- "Falling" = opposite
- No new API calls needed — data already fetched

**5. Historical Model Accuracy tracker**
- `preds/pre-tournament-archive` + `historical-raw/event-results`
- Show: at each venue, how has the top-ranked course-fit player finished historically?
- Validates the course-fit model with real outcomes
- Good Pro explainer content + credibility for subscriber retention

**6. FedExCup + Earnings vs SG analysis**
- `historical-raw/event-results` — earnings + FedExCup pts per player per event
- Correlate with historical SG categories to show which skills drive earnings
- Good article content + Pro educational section
- Example insight: "SG: Approach explains 62% of earnings variance on PGA Tour"

**7. DFS correlation section**
- `historical-dfs` — DK/FD fantasy points per player per slate
- Correlate with SG categories — which stats best predict DFS production
- Useful if adding a DFS angle to Lab Notes Pro

**8. Full Matchup backtesting**
- `historical-odds/matchups` — historical H2H lines
- Compare DataGolf model picks in H2H markets to closing lines and actual results
- Builds the scientific case for H2H picks as the highest-edge bet type

## Conventions Claude Should Follow

- **No comments in code** unless the WHY is non-obvious
- **No emojis** unless the user explicitly asks
- **Dark mode default** — always test light mode overrides exist when editing pages that have theme toggle
- **Mobile-first fixes** — the main user complaints have been mobile layout issues. Always check mobile breakpoints when editing CSS
- **Nested scroll containers on mobile are bad** — never put `max-height + overflow-y: auto` inside a page that also scrolls on mobile
- **Gitignored files** — instagram-library.html, partnership-guide.html, twitter-*.html, lab-notes/issues/*, lab-notes/lab-picks/20*.html are intentionally not tracked
- **season-tracker.json is the single source of truth** for all pick records. Never hardcode stats in HTML — always fetch from this file
- **current-pick.json is the single source of truth** for the live free pick. Never hardcode pick details in picks.html
- **pro-picks.json is the single source of truth** for all Pro picks this week. Drives the "This Week's Card" on /pro and the newsletter HTML. Generated via admin.html Pro Picks tab — never edit manually
- **Admin tool Pro Picks tab workflow**: Wednesday → fill picks → generate pro-picks.json → deploy. Monday → Load Current Values → update result dropdowns → regenerate → deploy
